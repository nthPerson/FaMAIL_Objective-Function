"""
FAMAIL Objective Function Package.

This package provides the objective function terms for the FAMAIL
(Fairness-Aware Multi-Agent Imitation Learning) system.

Objective Function:
    L(T') = α₁·F_causal + α₂·F_spatial + α₃·F_fidelity + α₄·F_quality

All terms are designed to be maximized, with values in [0, 1] where
higher values indicate better outcomes.

Available Terms:
    - spatial_fairness: Gini-based measure of service distribution equality
    - causal_fairness: R²-based measure of demand-service alignment (planned)
    - fidelity: Discriminator-based trajectory realism (planned)
    - quality: Multi-metric trajectory quality (planned)
